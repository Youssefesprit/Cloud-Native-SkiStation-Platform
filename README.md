# ⛷️ SkiStation – Microservices Configuration & Docker Deployment   

## 📌 Introduction  
This repository contains the **configuration and deployment setup** for the SkiStation project  
The main focus is on **Docker-based containerization** and orchestration of the microservices that make up the ski station management platform 
The microservices themselves are developed in separate repositories, while this repo provides the **infrastructure layer** for running them together

The SkiStation platform is composed of the following microservices:  

1. **Course Management Service**  
2. **Instructor Management Service**  
3. **Piste Management Service**  
4. **Registration Management Service**  
5. **Skier Management Service**  
6. **Subscription Management Service**  

Each service runs as an independent **Docker container**, allowing modularity, scalability, and ease of deployment
